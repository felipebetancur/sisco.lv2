This code is a slightly modified version of zita-resampler v1.3.0
http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/zita-resampler/resampler.html
by Fons Adriaensen licensed in terms of the GPLv3 (or later).

Modifications include:
 * dedicated namespace wrapper. Since plugins are loaded into address-
   space of a DAW, symbol names must not conflict with existing symbols.
 * make inp_data a const* pointer.
 * remove unused code for variable ratio
